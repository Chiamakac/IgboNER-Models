This is a repository for the IgboBERT Models trainings as presented in this paper: "IgboBERT Models: Building and Training Transformer Models for the
Igbo Language". We trained an IgboBERT model from scratch to have a baseline model for Igbo language and also finetuned some state-of-the-arts- transformer models which include mBERT, XLM_R_BERT, DistilBERT using Igbo data.
